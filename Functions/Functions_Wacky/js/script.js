/* Very simple operation that shows if a person consumes 5 or more Redbull's(energy drinks) in a day they would have heart problems that can cause illness or death, if they consume 2 or less they are ok and in no danger of heart problems and if they consume 3 or 4 in a day they would start to feel a sugar rush that can make there body feel less motivated and weak the rest of the day */
